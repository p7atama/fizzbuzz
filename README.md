# FizzBuzz Game

The FizzBuzz Game is a web application that generates a FizzBuzz sequence based on a user-provided number. It follows the classic FizzBuzz rules, where numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "Fizz," numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "Buzz," and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz." This app provides a fun way to explore the FizzBuzz concept and practice PHP programming skills.
